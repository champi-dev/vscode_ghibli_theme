The icon.png file should contain a 128x128 pixel image that represents the Studio Ghibli theme. Here are the specifications for what it should contain:

**Icon Design Description:**
- Background: Soft gradient from sky blue (#87CEEB) at the top to forest green (#4A7C59) at the bottom
- Central Element: A stylized leaf or tree symbol in the center, representing the nature themes prevalent in Ghibli films
- Accent: Small touches of sunset orange (#FFA07A) to add warmth
- Style: Simple, clean, and recognizable at small sizes
- Format: PNG with transparent areas if needed
- Dimensions: 128x128 pixels

The icon should evoke the feeling of Ghibli films without using copyrighted characters. Think of elements like:
- Floating leaves
- Stylized clouds
- Abstract forest shapes
- Gentle curves and organic forms

This icon will appear in the VS Code extensions marketplace and in the extensions sidebar.
